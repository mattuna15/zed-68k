<B>DESCRIPTION</B><BR><BR>

<B>Fsck.cpm is used to check and repair a CP/M file system.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
After reading the directory, it makes two passes.  The first pass checks
extent fields for range and format violations (bad status, extent number,
last record byte count, file name, extension, block number, record count,
size of .COM files, time stamp format, invalid password characters, invalid
time stamp mode).  The second pass checks extent connectivity (multiple
allocated blocks and duplicate directory entries).
<BR>
<BR>
<B>fsck.cpm can not yet repair all errors.</B>
<BR>
<BR>

<B>OPTIONS</B><BR><BR>

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<DT><B>-f</B><BR><DD>

Use the given CP/M disk <I>format</I> instead of the default format.
<BR><BR>
For Apple II CP/M 80
users the disk image formats apple-do and apple-po are available. These
are DOS3.3 order and ProDOS order disk image formats respectively, and must always be specified
using the form <b>-f apple-do</b> or <b>-f apple-po</b>.
<BR><BR>


<DT><B>-n</B><DD>
Open the file system read-only and do not repair any errors.
<BR>
<BR>
</DL>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<B>RETURN VALUE - Upon successful completion, exit code 0 is returned.</B><BR><BR>

This will likely only be of interest to programmers. In a Win32 system
the exit code can be trapped in a batch file as an "ERRORLEVEL" or as a
return value when run from another Win32 console program written in a
language like C.
<BR><BR>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<B>ERRORS - Any errors are indicated by exit code 1.</B><BR><BR>

This will likely only be of interest to programmers. In a Win32 system
the exit code can be trapped in a batch file as an "ERRORLEVEL" or as a
return value when run from another Win32 console program written in a
language like C.
<BR><BR>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<B>FILES - diskdefs - CP/M disk format definitions</B><BR><BR>

The diskdefs file is a plain ascii text file (in "unix" format, not Windows format)
that serves as a database of
disk and disk image format definitions. It can be reviewed for available CP/M
formats and their names. For Apple II CP/M 80 users the disk
image formats apple-do and apple-po are available.
<BR>
To convert between Windows text and "unix" text, two utilities (rmcr and cr) are
included in the Windows distro of the cpmtools binaries. These are included so you
can use a Windows text editor to edit a copy of diskdefs if your Windows text editor
does not edit "unix" text.
<BR><BR>
<b>The possible locations where cpmtools first looks for the diskdefs file:</b>
<BR>
<BR>
Can vary depending on the preferences of the person who builds the
cpmtools binaries (executables) from the source code.
<BR>
<BR>
<b>If it's not found the current (work) directory is then searched for a
file called diskdefs.</b>
<br>
<br>
The Windows distro uses <b>\cpmtools\diskdefs</b> as a default.
<BR>
<BR>
<b>On a unix-like system</b>, a <b>${prefix}/share/</b> style path
like <b>/usr/local/share/</b> is a possible place that cpmtools will first
look for diskdefs.
<BR>
<BR>
<b>In a Win32 system</b> sometimes unix-like shells like cygwin
are used to build and run cpmtools instead of Windows cmd. For those installations
unix-like conventions may apply.

<B>DIAGNOSTICS - <I>image</I>: used/total files (n.n% non-contiguos), used/total blocks</B>
<BR>
<BR>
No inconsistencies could be found.  The number of used files actually
is the number of used extents.  Since a file may use more than
one extent, this may be greater than the actual number of files, but a
correct measure would not reflect how many files could still be created
at most.  A file is considered fragmented, if sequential data blocks
pointed to by the same extent do not have sequential block numbers.
The number of used blocks includes the blocks used for system tracks
and the directory.
